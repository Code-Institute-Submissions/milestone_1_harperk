## Aim

The client is an illustrator who requested a website to showcase illustrations she creates 
for friends and family. The purpose of the website is to increase her client base and invite users
to submit their own ideas for unique illustrations.

The client has set the following criteria for the website:
1. The design should be professional with an element of fun.
2. The main focus should be the illustrations.
3. The user should be able to contact the illustrator.
4. There should be clear instructions as to how the user can contact the illustrator.

## UX

Harpoon Illustrations is a newly established company that currently has a very small client base 
consisting mainly of the illustrator's friends and family. The website is aimed at the wider public,
who are unlikely to be familiar with the illustrator's work. It is hoped that the users will
be potential clients, who will commission the illustrator to create bespoke illustrations for them, their
friends or family.

In order to attract users and build the client base, the website will:
1. Look aesthetically pleasing.
2. Draw the user in with humour.
3. Look simple and uncluttered to focus the attention on the illustrations.
4. Have clear instructions to easily allow the user to contact the illustrator.

### User Stories

"As a user of the Harpoon Illustrations site, I want the website to look stylish as this instills confidence about the quality of the illustrations."

"As a user of the site, I want to see the illustrator's previous work to get ideas for potential work I can request."

"As a user of the site, I want an easy way to get in touch with the illustrator directly so I can discuss potential ideas."
